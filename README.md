# TripSit Drugs Database GitHub Repository
> **This repository serves as the database for TripSit’s Drug Factsheets and Drug Combination Chart**

There are currently two main files for this database, "drugs.json" and "combos.json"
* drugs.json is the file used by TripBot, Factsheets, along with related resources and tools
* combos.json is the file containing all combination data for TripSit's Drug Combination Chart

If you would like to contribute and are unfamiliar with GitHub, the easiest way to contribute is through a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/TripSit/drugs/discussions).

## Drug Combination Chart
> TripSit's Drug Combination Chart is undergoing a large project to expand, revise, and update the current edition of the chart. You can learn more and see the latest for this project on our [Research Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cT4wONr4GsijbzeYPAFpSpZh0Mq5u7SEQkTHbxDxAVA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Combination Issues
* Any interactions in issues are ready to be made into pull requests unless otherwise stated. These will need to be added to combos.json and, when relevant, drugs.json
* You can see an example of this done here: https://github.com/TripSit/drugs/pull/302

### Peer Review
* As discussed in the aforementioned Research Document, four new drugs are being added to the combination chart. These are pregabalin, 4-MMC, lithium, and DPH. The majority of these interactions are in a "rough draft" or otherwise in a "peer review" stage. The best way to contribute to reviewing these interactions is through our Research Document.
* Alternatively, you are welcome to create an issue with a peer review for any combination. 

### Conducting a Peer Review
https://github.com/TripSit/drugs/wiki/Getting-Started-%7C-TripSit's-Combination-Chart-Project#conducting-a-peer-review

### Alpha Stage Interactions
* Interactions in the alpha stage are combinations that are not ready for peer review. These are interactions we’ve had difficulty concluding the interaction for and could use the most help with.
* You can find these in our GitHub's discussion page: https://github.com/TripSit/drugs/discussions/categories/questions

### Contribution Criteria
* We strive to provide as accurate information as possible. This includes providing explanations for modifications and sources to accompany these changes.
* No changes will be accepted without a reference to a reliable source.
  * Studies are preferred to be cited in APA 7th edition format. You can use tools like Zotero to automatically generate these.
* Examples of reliable sources include:
  * .edu or .gov websites
  * peer-reviewed research studies
  * books
  * credible harm reduction organizations

## Drugs Database
* drugs.json is a massive file containing all of our drug information used by our factsheets and more.
  * The database would benefit from revisions, sources, additions, modifications, and more. Feel free to contribute in any way to improve our database.

## Development Information
* We would greatly benefit from more developers, ranging from UX/UI design to backend server administration. To learn more, see our [development information wiki page](https://github.com/TripSit/drugs/wiki/Development-Information).
